The original Paper suggests that the study should be based age-structure SEIR Model in
order to analysis TB in mainland China. However, In this review, a SIR model based on no latent population
and dynamic health index is introduced to refine the model. Advanced Internet self diagnosis
and advanced health facility can detect patients when they show slight symptom, which can isolates
the patients before they are sick and infectious.That is the assumption to remove the latent component
of the model. The dynamic health index is that a dynamic index growing with time, which indicates
the improvement of medical facility and society health environment. Another assumption is that health
index grows with time. This paper test the different models to show the effect of each additional component
of the model and refine it.
