# TB-Transmission-Modeling
The task was to build model to describe and predict TB transmission in China from around 2000 to 2030.
## PDE model
I used SEIR/SIR model to fit the TB transmission data.

## Experiments
I tried different model, and droped/added different parameters to compare the model fitting.
However, the professor told us it did not matter whether the model fitted to the data.
